# What is OOP?
import numpy as np

a = np.array([1,2,3,4])

print(type(a))

# calling type on object a returns <class 'numpy.ndarray'>, indicating that object a is a ndarray (or n-dimentional array)

print(dir(a))

# calling dir on an object returns all of the attributes and methods applicable to the object
